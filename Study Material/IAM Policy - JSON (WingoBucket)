The IAM polciy gets attached to identities inside of AWS. Which are set of security statements to AWS, which grants or denies access.

Above are multiple statements (2)
The first statement allows full access to all of the S3 service. All S3 actions on all resources.
The second statement denies to a small portion of S3. Which is the batmangifs bucket and all the things in that bucket.

As you can see in the second statement it has the "Effect": "Deny", > The policy denies access to a resource and nothing can overrule that deny.
In the explicit allow, you can access all S3 actions on any resource. Unless there is a explicit deny. 
Just remember Explict denys always take over anything
