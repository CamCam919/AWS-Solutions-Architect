# AWS-Solutions-Architect

This is to help anyone interested in studying the AWS CSA.
In the provided documents, there are many PDF files involving....

Databases-
Decoupling Workflows-
Migration-

And so much more...
The reasoning behind these documents is to showcase my studies, my note taking skills, and one day help others with the "How-To's" documents on how to do certain things within AWS.


Most of these are from the course on aCloudGuru and some of from Udemy.

Instructors from aCloudGuru (Most of it)
  - Ryan Kroonenburg
  - Alex Galvin

Instructors from udemy (Small portion)
  - Stephane Maarek

Different small courses on AWS Skill Builder
https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/home
  - This is just searching up services to get more of a broad understanding

And previous notes I have taken when I went for my cloud practitioner.
